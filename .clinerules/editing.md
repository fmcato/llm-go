# Rules for editing files

- Never change a file only to add an unused import. Include the code that uses the import in the same change.
  - Likewise when erasing code do not make a change to only erase the imports. Erase the code in the same change.
- Adhere to best practices of the programming language used
- If a function is getting long, split it into multiple ones.
