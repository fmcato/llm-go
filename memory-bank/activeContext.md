# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Completed refactoring the codebase to use an internal package structure for better organization and maintainability.

## Recent Changes
- ✅ Added temperature parameter configuration via environment variables
- ✅ Added hide-thinking flag for content filtering
- ✅ Implemented LLMClient struct for better encapsulation
- ✅ Added conversation history within sessions
- ✅ Improved error handling and validation
- ✅ Added system prompt loading from file
- ✅ Created comprehensive configuration management
- ✅ **Refactored codebase into internal packages**:
  - `internal/llm` - OpenAI client interface and implementation
  - `internal/config` - Configuration management
  - `internal/memory` - Conversation history management
  - `internal/cli` - Command-line interface handling
- ✅ **Enhanced conversation storage**: Removed thinking blocks from stored responses while preserving display functionality

## Next Steps
1. **Testing Implementation**:
   - Add unit tests for configuration loading
   - Add integration tests for LLM client
   - Add CLI interaction tests

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Add package-level documentation
   - Create usage examples

3. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Add persistence layer for conversation history
   - Implement plugin system for custom LLM providers
   - Add web interface with RESTful API

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Package Structure**: Following Go best practices with internal packages for better encapsulation
- **Testing Strategy**: Starting with unit tests for configuration and client logic
- **API Design**: Maintaining backward compatibility while improving internal structure
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across all packages
- **Configuration**: Keeping environment-based config but making it more robust

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- **Package Organization**: Use internal packages to prevent external imports
- **Interface Design**: Create clean interfaces for LLM operations
- **Error Handling**: Use Go's error wrapping and custom error types
- **Configuration**: Maintain single source of truth for configuration
- **Testing**: Write tests alongside implementation (TDD approach)

## Learnings & Insights
- The refactored structure provides much better organization and maintainability
- Temperature parameter implementation shows good pattern for future config options
- Hide-thinking flag demonstrates how to add CLI features cleanly
- Conversation history works well in-memory but needs persistence
- The LLMClient struct provides good encapsulation for future testing
- Package separation makes the codebase much more modular and testable

## Technical Debt Addressed
- ✅ Main.go is now a thin entry point
- ✅ Configuration loading is more robust with validation
- ✅ Clear separation between business logic and CLI interface
- ✅ Better organized code structure for future testing

## Architecture Decisions Implemented
- **internal/llm**: Contains LLMClient and all OpenAI interactions
- **internal/config**: Handles all configuration loading and validation
- **internal/memory**: Manages conversation history and persistence
- **internal/cli**: Handles command-line parsing and user interaction
- **main.go**: Minimal entry point that coordinates these packages
