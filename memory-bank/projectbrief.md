# LLM-Go Project Brief

## Project Overview
LLM-Go is a command-line interface tool written in Go that provides a simple way to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) through OpenAI-compatible APIs. The tool allows users to send messages to LLMs and receive streaming responses.

## Core Requirements
1. **LLM Integration**: Connect to OpenAI-compatible APIs (OpenAI, Ollama, custom endpoints)
2. **Configuration Management**: Load API keys and settings from environment variables and .env files
3. **Streaming Responses**: Provide real-time response streaming for better user experience
4. **Command-line Interface**: Simple and intuitive CLI with configurable options
5. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for network issues and API errors

## Project Goals
- Create a lightweight, fast LLM client
- Support multiple LLM providers and models
- Provide flexible configuration options
- Maintain clean, maintainable Go codebase

## Target Users
- Developers who want to integrate LLM capabilities into their workflows
- System administrators needing AI assistance for tasks
- Anyone who wants a simple CLI tool for LLM interactions
