# Progress Tracking

## What Works
- âœ… Basic LLM client implementation with OpenAI-compatible APIs
- âœ… Streaming response functionality
- âœ… Configuration management with environment variables and .env file support
- âœ… Command-line interface with user input
- âœ… Error handling for API connections and user input
- âœ… Support for custom API endpoints (Ollama, local servers)
- âœ… Model selection via configuration
- âœ… System prompt customization via file input
- âœ… Temperature parameter configuration (0.0-2.0 range)
- âœ… Hide-thinking flag for filtering response content
- âœ… Conversation history within a single session
- âœ… Clean separation of concerns with LLMClient struct
- âœ… **Refactored internal package structure**:
  - `internal/llm` - OpenAI client interface and implementation
  - `internal/config` - Configuration management
  - `internal/memory` - Conversation history management
  - `internal/cli` - Command-line interface handling

## What's Left to Build
- ðŸ”„ Refactor code to have an internal package to interface with OpenAI
- ðŸ”² Unit and integration tests
- ðŸ”² Documentation improvements
- ðŸ”² Performance optimizations
- ðŸ”² Additional CLI features (history browsing, etc.)
- ðŸ”² Persistent conversation history between sessions
- ðŸ”² Multi-model support with model switching
- ðŸ”² Advanced configuration options (max tokens, top-p, etc.)
- ðŸ”² Rate limiting and request throttling
- ðŸ”² Better error messages with debugging information

## Current Status
The core LLM client functionality is complete and working. The application successfully connects to OpenAI-compatible APIs, sends messages with conversation history, and receives streaming responses. Temperature is now configurable via environment variables, and the hide-thinking flag provides basic content filtering capability.

## Known Issues
- No conversation history retention between sessions (in-memory only)
- Basic error messages without detailed debugging information
- No built-in rate limiting or request throttling
- No persistent storage of conversations
- Single-threaded execution (no concurrent requests)

## Evolution of Project Decisions
### Phase 1: Core Implementation
- **Decision**: Start with minimal dependencies and basic functionality
- **Rationale**: Focus on core LLM integration before adding complexity
- **Outcome**: Working LLM client with streaming responses

### Phase 2: Configuration Management
- **Decision**: Use environment variables with .env file support
- **Rationale**: Standard approach for configuration management in Go applications
- **Outcome**: Flexible configuration system that works locally and in production

### Phase 3: Enhanced Configuration
- **Decision**: Add temperature parameter and hide-thinking flag
- **Rationale**: Provide more control over LLM behavior and output
- **Outcome**: Users can now control response creativity and filter content

### Phase 4: Code Organization
- **Decision**: Create LLMClient struct for better encapsulation
- **Rationale**: Improve code maintainability and testability
- **Outcome**: Clean separation between client logic and main application flow

## Recent Improvements
- Added streaming response support for better user experience
- Implemented robust configuration loading with fallbacks
- Added command-line flags for runtime options
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added temperature parameter configuration
- Added hide-thinking flag for content filtering
- Implemented conversation history within sessions
- Created LLMClient struct for better code organization

## Future Enhancements
- Advanced configuration options (max tokens, top-p, frequency penalty, etc.)
- Multi-model support with model-specific configurations
- Persistent conversation storage (file-based or database)
- Web interface for browser-based usage
- Plugin system for custom functionality
- Batch processing capabilities
- Conversation export/import functionality
